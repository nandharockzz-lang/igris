"""Descriptor-first file helpers, shared by the daemon and jarvis-config.

Every path Jarvis touches is predictable -- ~/.config/jarvis/config.toml, the
voices directory, an agent's reply file -- and two of the readers are
long-lived (the always-on listener and the settings panel behind the bar
widget). A plain `open(path)` on a predictable path is three separate hazards:

  * a symlink planted at that name redirects the open somewhere else,
  * a FIFO planted at that name blocks the open, or the read after it,
    forever -- which stalls the UI or the service rather than failing it,
  * an oversized file is read wholly into memory.

So nothing here opens a path by name and trusts what comes back. Every read
opens with O_NONBLOCK (opening a FIFO returns immediately instead of waiting
for a writer), checks the *descriptor* with fstat before reading a byte --
regular file, expected owner -- and reads a bounded number of bytes. Reads
also refuse a symlink at the final component (O_NOFOLLOW) unless the caller
opts out, which only the .desktop scan does, where a user's symlink is
ordinary and the descriptor checks still apply. Every write goes to an unpredictable private
temporary file in the destination directory and is moved into place with
os.replace, so a reader sees either the old file or the new one and never a
half-written one, and there is no guessable `.tmp` name to pre-plant.

O_NOFOLLOW only covers the last path component; the parent directories here
are the user's own $XDG_* dirs, created 0700 where we create them.
