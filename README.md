# Jarvis: a wake-word voice assistant for the Omarchy bar

Say **"hey jarvis"**, ask a question, hear the answer. A bar widget arms and
disarms the listener and shows what it is doing.

Everything except the agent call runs on your machine: [openWakeWord] listens
on a continuous 16kHz mic stream, [voxtype]'s local whisper model transcribes,
[piper] speaks the reply. Only the transcribed *text* ever leaves the machine,
and only when you say the wake word.

Which agent answers is configuration, not code. Ships a tested, tool-free
preset for **Claude Code**; adding another CLI is a few lines of TOML, with
the caveat described in [`config/config.toml.example`](config/config.toml.example).

## ⚠️ Read this before installing

This puts an **always-on microphone daemon** on your machine. It holds the mic
open whenever it is armed, and when it hears the wake word it sends what you
said to whichever agent you configured, which is a cloud service unless you
point it at a local model.

It is off until you arm it, and the widget shows when it is listening. But you
should be comfortable with that trade before installing. Omarchy plugins run
unsandboxed with your user's permissions.

**Actions are off by default.** Set `actions = true` and the agent can also
**launch apps and open URLs**. Worth being precise about what holds that
line: the agent CLI is never granted a shell or a tool, in either mode, and
that is a flag on the invocation rather than a hope -- the shipped Claude
preset passes `--tools ""` (the empty built-in allowlist) and
`--strict-mcp-config` with no `--mcp-config`, so neither the built-in tools
nor any MCP server from your own config is loaded for the call. To
act, it ends its reply with a structured `<<jarvis:open-app …>>` or
`<<jarvis:open-url …>>` line; the daemon parses that against a strict
pattern, validates the argument, and directly execs `jarvis-open` -- a broker
that can start an installed `.desktop` entry or open an `http(s)` URL and
nothing else, and that re-validates its arguments itself. No shell sits
anywhere in that path, and with `actions = false` directives are stripped and
ignored. Turn it on if you want a voice assistant that acts. Leave it off and
the agent can only talk.

**Web search is off by default.** Give an agent a `web_command` (see the
example config) and it can answer with one web-enabled round: the normal
no-tools call may reply with a search request, and Jarvis re-invokes the
agent with the CLI's own read-only search tool granted -- `WebSearch` for
Claude Code, enforced by the CLI -- and nothing else. The two calls split the
trust: the call that can act never saw the web, and the call that saw the web
cannot act -- every directive in its reply is stripped and ignored, and there
is no second hop. So a hostile page the search surfaced can at worst say
something wrong out loud; it cannot open apps or URLs or search again. Two
things to accept before enabling it: your question may reach a search
provider through the agent, and a spoken answer is only as good as the pages
behind it.

A mode toggle is one keybinding away in `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua`:

```lua
o.bind("SUPER + SHIFT + J", "Jarvis Basic/Full toggle",
       "/home/sicarius/.local/share/jarvis/bin/jarvis-toggle")
```

(Adjust the home directory to yours: that is where `install.sh` puts the
helper.) Stopped -> Basic -> Full -> stopped. Arming also flips the broker
verbs flag on for the selected voice agent (and disarming flips it back, so
Safe can never refuse startup); hand-editing `actions` still works but the
toggle will manage it from then on. The hotkey only *requests*: the daemon
validates every transition and owns the state, so a refused combination
surfaces as an error instead of switching. A second press on Full disarms
immediately and stops new tool calls.

Panic stays separate, on `SUPER + SHIFT + K`:

```lua
o.bind("SUPER + SHIFT + K", "Jarvis panic (stop everything)",
       "/home/sicarius/.local/share/jarvis/bin/jarvis-rollback --panic")
```

That stops the listener, terminates tracked privileged runs, and clears the
arm state, mid-word. The bar widget's right-click steps the same Basic/Full
toggle with a mouse, and tapping the panel avatar disarms.

**Modes.** `Safe` answers only and is the only always-on mode. `Basic`
(workspace) adds Siri-like broker verbs -- volume, brightness, apps,
workspaces, mute, media transport keys, YouTube search-and-play, and your
own library (`mymusic liked|watchlater|playlist NAME`, opened logged-in in
your default browser with zero credentials on our side) -- on an explicit
arm window (30 min default) with no shell, no files, no tools. Set
`player = "mpv"` under `[music]` and songs play as audio with no window at
all (`"mpv-video"` for a small always-on-top window instead); pause, resume,
skip and closing the player keep working through the media verb
("pause", "next", "quit the music"). no files, no tools. Routine
commands ("play X", "pause", "volume up") never reach the model: the daemon
matches them locally and runs the same broker, so they answer in about a
second; anything ambiguous falls through to the assistant.
no files, no tools. `Full` (privileged) adds sandboxed full-tools on a short
5-minute window with a visible countdown; destructive operations always need
a keyboard/button confirmation -- voice may announce Full mode but never
authorizes destruction. The widget shows an anime avatar (ring: blue Safe,
green Basic, orange Full, gray mic-off, red error), a mode badge with
countdown, a live mic EQ while listening, and a tool-category chip while
working. Mouth movement follows real Piper playback amplitude; the EQ follows
live gated mic levels and dims when listening ends. Tapping the panel avatar
disarms. Reduced-motion and high-contrast options live in the widget
settings. None of this changes permissions: the daemon enforces every mode
invariant exactly as before.

**Rollback** is `jarvis-rollback`: it terminates tracked privileged runs
first (config edits alone could never stop them), clears the arm state, sets
`agent=opencode-voice`, `mode=safe`, `actions=false`, and restarts the daemon
only if it was running.

Two more things worth knowing:

- What you say is handed to the agent CLI on **stdin**, never on its command
  line (argv is readable by every process on the machine), and the journal
  records how long each exchange was, not what was said -- unless you opt in
  with `log_transcripts = true`.
- Anything running as your user can arm the listener over Quickshell's IPC
  (`qs ipc call dorian.voice arm`), the same way the widget does. A
  notification fires when it does, unless you turn notifications off.
- The systemd unit is not sandboxed with `ProtectHome` and friends. It cannot
  be: its whole job is to launch an agent CLI that reads your files.

## Install

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/dorianorellanobbap/omarchy-jarvis.git --enable
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/dorian.voice/install.sh
```

Or from a clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dorianorellanobbap/omarchy-jarvis.git
cd omarchy-jarvis && ./install.sh
```

The script builds a Python venv, fetches and checksums the piper voice (63MB),
installs a systemd **user** unit, writes a starter config, and verifies the
result. It is idempotent, so re-run it any time. Then add the **Voice Assistant**
widget to your bar and log out and back in.

The unit is installed but **not enabled**: nothing holds the mic open until you
arm it from the widget. If you want it armed from login, that is an explicit
`systemctl --user enable jarvis`.

**Requires:** Python 3.11+, PipeWire (`pw-record`/`pw-play`),
`voxtype` (ships with Omarchy), and the CLI of whichever agent you pick.

## Use

| Click | Does |
| --- | --- |
| Left | Open the settings panel |
| Right | Step the Basic/Full toggle |
| Middle | Restart the listener |

Armed, it costs about 3% of one core. Say the wake word, wait for the chime,
then talk. The widget icon shows where it is: waiting, listening, thinking,
speaking.

```sh
J=~/.local/share/jarvis
$J/bin/jarvis-config show                                # settings as JSON
$J/venv/bin/python $J/jarvis-listen.py --agents          # what's configured
$J/venv/bin/python $J/jarvis-listen.py --check           # verify deps
$J/venv/bin/python $J/jarvis-listen.py --ask "hello"     # test without the mic
journalctl --user -u jarvis -f                           # watch it work
```

## Configure

The panel covers the everyday settings: agent, wake word, sensitivity, how
long a pause ends your question, how long a question may run. Changes are
written straight to the config file. The listener reads its config once at
startup, so the panel restarts it for you when it is armed; when it is
disarmed the change simply applies next time you arm it.

Everything else lives in `~/.config/jarvis/config.toml`. See
[`config/config.toml.example`](config/config.toml.example) for every option,
commented.

```toml
agent     = "claude"        # or grok, or opencode-voice
wake_word = "hey_jarvis"    # or alexa, hey_mycroft, hey_marvin
model     = "grok-4.6"      # panel Model dropdown; grok and OpenCode agents
```

**Grok** uses the Grok Build CLI (`grok` on PATH, logged in at grok.com).
Pick the `grok` agent in the panel, then Grok 4.6 or 4.5. The voice preset
denies every filesystem/shell/web tool (`--disallowed-tools`); empty
`--tools ""` is **not** a deny on this CLI.

Hand-edit it freely: writes from the panel go through `jarvis-config`, which
rewrites a single line and leaves the rest of the file, comments included,
exactly as you wrote it. It also refuses to touch anything under `[agents.*]`,
so no click in the panel can change the command the daemon executes.

### Adding an agent

`command` is argv, never a shell string, so nothing you say can be interpreted
as shell. Three placeholders are substituted into individual arguments:

| Placeholder | Becomes |
| --- | --- |
| `{system}` | the voice-style system prompt Jarvis builds |
| `{outfile}` | a temp file. If present, the reply is read from there instead of stdout |
| `{prompt}` | what you said, transcribed. **Leave it out** (both presets do) and the transcript is fed to the CLI on stdin instead, keeping it out of the process list. Name neither `{prompt}` nor `{system}` and stdin gets both, system prompt first |

```toml
[agents.mycli]
command = ["mycli", "--quiet", "{system}\n\n{prompt}"]
actions = false
```

Use `{outfile}` when the CLI prints progress logs to stdout, or
`strip_prefixes = ["INFO", "Loading"]` to drop noise lines. Then check it with
`--agents` and `--ask`. **PRs adding a working preset are welcome.**

`actions = true` works with any CLI: acting is reply parsing, not a tool
grant. The agent asks by ending its reply with a `<<jarvis:open-… >>`
directive line, and the daemon brokers it through `jarvis-open`. The CLI
needs no tool support at all, and none of the presets pass any tool flags.

`web_command` is the one exception, and it is opt-in: web search only works
with a CLI that can grant a read-only search tool by flag (Claude Code can).
A CLI that cannot simply stays search-less -- do not reach for a fetch tool
or a shell to fake it; the daemon will warn, and a hostile page would thank
you.

## How it works

```
mic ──> openWakeWord ──> [wake word] ──> record until silence
                                              │
                                         voxtype (local whisper)
                                              │
                                          agent CLI
                                              │
                                       piper ──> speakers
```

Pipeline state is written to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/jarvis/state`, so the widget
reads a file instead of talking to the process.

The settings panel is QML and the daemon's config is TOML, which QML cannot
parse. Rather than teach the widget about TOML, or move the settings somewhere
the daemon would need Omarchy to read them, the panel shells out to
`jarvis-config`, which prints JSON and writes single lines.

## Notes from building it

- An always-on mic forces AirPods into mono HFP. Pin your default source to
  the internal mic if that bites.
- `pw-record` exits early if its stderr is `DEVNULL`. It needs a real file.
- While the agent is thinking, nothing drains the mic pipe, so it holds stale
  audio including Jarvis's own reply. The stream is restarted after every
  exchange rather than replayed.

## Uninstall

```sh
./uninstall.sh          # keeps your config
./uninstall.sh --purge  # removes it too
